# AOC_site
AOC_site is a frotend React app hosted on netlify at https://aoc-2020-visualized.netlify.app/.  The two pages are based on days 11 and 12 from the [2020 Advent of Code challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

This app was origionally designed to highlight implicit animation in react. A component state is updated within a useInterval hook, which triggers an evenly spaced out animation.  Both days' solutions are solved in the browser at runtime. 

Day 11 highlights a modified [cellular automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) where seats on a ship are filled or empitied according to the rules of their neighbors. Day 11 demonstrates the movement of a "ship" around a 2D grid
